# Purpose

At present, the existing syntax aids for writing NONMEM control files are too weak to provide users with a good environment for getting started, and there are no tools for Chinese annotations, so this tool is developed. Another purpose of developing this tool is to make some contribution to the community so that people have better tools to use.
